# 👋 Hi there, I’m Oleksandr Sheniak

I'm a cybersecurity professional in transition — combining a strong background in tech, business, and project leadership to build a future in enterprise security.

## 🚀 My Journey So Far

🔹 **IT & Business Hybrid**: With over a decade of experience across front-end development, Android, project coordination, e-commerce, and team leadership, I bring a 360° perspective to problem-solving in fast-paced environments.

🔹 **Cybersecurity Focused**: Currently pursuing **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** and expanding my hands-on skills via **TryHackMe**, **SoftServe’s Cybersecurity Fundamentals**, and custom labs in areas like:
- Threat modeling
- Incident response
- Network security
- Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)

🔹 **Cloud-Centric Ambitions**: I'm aligning my skill set with the cybersecurity demands of major cloud platforms — AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle — with long-term goals of contributing to secure cloud infrastructure and defense-grade resilience.

🔹 **Learning by Doing**:
- 🧠 [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/sheniaks)

- 📚 Lab notebooks (AI threats, CVEs, TCPDump, SQL injection, Nmap, OSINT, and more)
- 🧾 Certifications in progress: Security+, AWS Security, ISC² CC, and beyond

## 🔐 Current Mission
Building a portfolio that showcases real-world skills, not just credentials. From cyber threat intelligence to automation in security operations, I’m learning, documenting, and contributing every day.
